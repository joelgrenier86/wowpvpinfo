# wowpvpinfo
A World of Warcraft information website focused on PvP

This is, initially, a tool to allow World of Warcraft  players to confirm which spells share a "diminishing returns" category in player vs player combat.
This project was started using django but didn't have a modern enough feel for my preferences, so I created a REST api with django rest framework and built the front-end using Vue and quasar.  In the future i would change to fastAPI back-end to reduce bloat.

This tool is functional and responsive but is still in a pre-release state.
